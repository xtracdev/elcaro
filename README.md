## Elcaro

Base image with Oracle Instant Client installed.

### Set Up

If you are building this behind an HTTP proxy, you'll need to copy 
apt.conf.template to apt.conf and edit it to reflect your proxy configuration.

If you are not building this behind an HTTP proxy, you need to remove the 
COPY apt.conf line from the Docker files.

Note that you will need to download the Oracle instant client files for
Linux from [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/linuxx86-64soft-092277.html)
and place them locally under `oracle/linux` - refer to the Dockerfile 
for the specifics and the relative file path.

### Use

Dockerfile creates a base image that is configured with the Oracle instant
client software. It can be used to containerize go applications that require
the Oracle instant client software.

This creates a base image named elcaro.
